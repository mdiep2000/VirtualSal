## Virtual Sal

Final project for CSCI 201. Collaborated with Josh Meidl, Ahmed Yacoob, Jafur Ahmed, Melina Elysian, Yiwen Wang.

### Description

Similar to the structure of a popular educational platform called Chegg, this program caters primarily to USC Viterbi Computer Science students with a website allowing students (users) to ask and/or answer questions related to assignments, courses, professors, etc. To differentiate guests and users, guests can only search and view posts while users enjoy all other features of the program.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
